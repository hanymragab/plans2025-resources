# IEEE/ION PLANS 2025 Resources

This repository supports several publications based on my Ph.D. thesis:  
**"Integration of Topological Maps with GNSS and Onboard Sensors for Robust Land Vehicle Navigation"**  
(Queenâ€™s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, July 2024).  

The publications currently supported are:  
1. **"Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS"**  
   (IEEE/ION PLANS 2025 paper, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00242) and [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11028310).  
2. **"Waypoint-Informed Localization (WiL): A Novel Integration of 2D Maps and Onboard Sensors for Robust GNSS-Denied Navigation"**  
   (journal paper, submitted).
